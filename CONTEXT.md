# Booki project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

The company wants to develop a website that allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice. <br />

You are in charge of integrating the website interface with HTML and CSS code. You will work closely with Sarah, the CTO, and Lo√Øc, the UI designer. <br />

### My role

For this project I had to create HTML and CSS code based on a model, images and a summary note were given to me to explain where breakpoints were supposed to be and how the different element of the page reacted to interactions.
